# Bringup-Bench Benchmark Suite

Bringup */bring-up/* **verb**
Refers to the process of bringing a newly designed and implemented CPU, accelerator, compiler, or operating system to life and verifying its functionality.

## Introduction

The Bringup-Bench Benchmark Suite is a collection of C code benchmarks that are purpose-built to be useful in "bringing up" newly designed CPUs, accelerators, compilers, and operating systems. Bringup-Bench facilitates the bringup process because i) its benchmarks have zero library dependencies since the "libmin" library included in the repo implements all the necessary library calls, ii) its benchmarks have near-zero system dependencies since only four simple system calls must be implement to support all the benchmarks, and iii) the benchmark build process supports code-based read-only file access, which allows benchmark file inputs to be packaged into the benchmark build.

I (Todd Austin) have used this benchmark suite to bring up new CPUs, new compiler infrastructure and even recently a Turing-complete encrypted computation accelerator. Most developers probably don't need bringup-bench, but if you do need it, you probably need it very badly!

## Bringing up Bringup-Bench
To build and test a benchmark, simply enter one of the benchmark directories and execute the following makefile command:
```
make TARGET=<target> clean build test
```
This command will first "clean" the benchmark directory and then "build" the application, and "test" that it is running correctly. The \<target> indicates the specific target that the application should be built for. Currently, Bringup-Bench support the following targets: 

- **Linux host target - TARGET=host** - This target builds the benchmarks to run as a Linux application.

- **Standalone target - TARGET=standalone** - This target builds the benchmarks to run as a memory-only standalone application. For this target, all benchmark output is spooled to a pre-defined memory buffer, and the libmin\_success() and libmin\_fail() intefaces result in the application spinning at a specific code address. This mode is designed for bringing up CPUs and accelerators that do not yet have any OS or device I/O support. See common/libtarg.c for the internal intefaces used to spool program output to internal buffers. This particular target is useful in bringing up CPUs when they still have no I/O support, simply spool benchmark output to DRAM, and dump the DRAM after the benchmark completes.

- **Simple_System target - TARGET=simple** - This target build the benchmarks to run in the RISC-V Simple_System simulation environment. Simple_system allows hardware developers to do SystemVerilog development on Verilator, with fast SystemVerilog simulation using the Simple_System target. The Simple_System target supports a character output device, plus a simple memory system. By default, this is an integer computation only mode, so any FP in the benchmarks will be emulated with GCC's soft-float support. To learn more about the RISC-V Simple_System, go here: https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex/blob/master/examples/simple_system/README.md. The current version of the Simple_System target was tested with: 1) Ibex "small" core, 2) Simple_System default devices and memory configuration.

- **RISC-V Spike target = TARGET=spike** - This target is identical to the "simple" target, as it build RISC-V binaries to be run on the Spike instruction set simulator (ISS). Spike is configured to support the Simple_system RISC-V I/O devices. This target is useful as a "golden" model to compare against execution traces occurring on a (perhaps buggy) RTL design target. Before first running a simulation, do a "make spike-build" in the top-level bringup-bench directory to make the Spike device DLL.

- **RISC-V Spike + Proxy Kernel (PK) target = TARGET=spike-pk** - This target runs the benchmarks on the RISC-V spike instruction set simulator with proxy kernel (pk). It builds RISC-V binaries to be run on the Spike instruction set simulator (ISS). Spike is configured to proxy kernel system calls (pk). This target is useful as a "golden" model to compare against execution traces occurring on a (perhaps buggy) RTL design target.

- **HashAlone Host target - TARGET=hashalone-host** - This target builds the benchmarks to run on x86/Linux with a hashing output device. Instead of producing output, hash-alone binaries simply send the program output to a hash function. When the program completes it prints the final value of the hash function, which is cryptographically unique for every possible output of the program.

- **HashAlone Spike target - TARGET=hashalone-spike** - This target builds the benchmarks to run on bare-metal RISC-V with a hashing output device. Instead of producing output, hash-alone binaries simply send the program output to a hash function. When the program completes it prints the final value of the hash function, which is cryptographically unique for every possible output of the program. Use this target to enhance your "golden model" to support reference hash-alone signatures for the bringup-bench benchmarks.

Each benchmark support three standard Makefile targets: build, test, and clean

- **build** - Builds the benchmark

- **test** - Runs the benchmark and validates its output.

- **clean** - Deleted all derived files.

For example, to build, test and then clean the Bubble Sort benchmark in encrypted mode:
```
make TARGET=host build
make TARGET=host test
make TARGET=host clean
```

To assist in running experiments, the top-level Makefile includes a few useful targets:
```
make TARGET=<target> run-tests   # clean, build, and test all benchmarks in the specified target mode (host, standalone, simple)
make all-clean   # clean all benchmark directories for all supported targets
```
You should be able to adapt these targets to your own project-specific tasks.

## Minimal library dependencies

Bringup-Bench has no library dependencies, to reduce the amount of system infrastructure needed to get your first application running. Instead of needing system libraries, Bringup-bench implements its own library in "libmin". "libmin" includes most of what simple applications need, including:

- printing values
- parsing numbers from text
- options parsing
- string processing
- memory copy and setting
- program exit interfaces
- pseudo-random number generation
- dynamic storage allocator
- code-based read-only file access functions
- sorting functions
- character class tests (from ctype.h)
- floating-point math functions

See the file "common/libmin.h" for more details.

## Minimal system dependencies

To minimize the system OS requirements, the Bringup-Bench only requires four system call interfaces to be implement. The interfaced required are as follows:
```
/* benchmark completed successfully */
void libtarg_success(void);

/* benchmark completed with error CODE */
void libtarg_fail(int code);

/* output a single character, to wherever the target wants to send it... */
void libtarg_putc(char c);

/* get some memory */
void *libtarg_sbrk(size_t inc);
```
Once these four interfaces are implemented, all of the Bringup-Bench benchmarks can be built and run. To facilitate testing, the "TARGET=host" target defines the four required system interfaces by passing them on to the Linux OS. In addition, the repo also provides a standalone target "TARGET=sa" which only requires that the target support provbable memory.

Optionally, the following two system calls can be implemented and enabled by defining `LIBTARG_PERF_HOOKS`:

```c
/* start perf-monitoring */
void libtarg_start_perf();

/* stop perf-monitoring */
void libtarg_stop_perf();
```

These hooks, if enabled, are called at the beginning and end of each benchmark, and can be used for platform specific instrumentation and performance monitoring.

For benchmarks where computation is self-contained, only the core computation is placed in between the markers. For all other benchmarks, the complete benchmark code is placed between the markers.

## Using the code-based read-only file system

Using the code-based read-only file system, it is possible for a benchmark to access a read-only file that is incorporated into its code. To convert an input file to a read-only code-based file, use the following command (shown for the benchmark "anagram"):
```
python3 scriptsr/file2hex.py words words.h __words
```
Where "words" is the file to convert, "words.h" is the name of the output header file with the data, and "__words" is the name of the variable defined in the header file "words.h". The resulting file produces two values: __words_sz is the size of the data in the __words array. To access the file, include into a MFILE definition in the benchmark file, for example:
```
MFILE __mwords = {
  "words",
  __words_sz,
  __words,
  0
};
MFILE *mwords = &__mwords;
```
Now the code-based read-only memory file "mwords" is now available for opening, reading, and closing. The following interfaces are available to access memory files:
```
/* open an in-memory file */
void libmin_mopen(MFILE *mfile, const char *mode);

/* return in-memory file size */
size_t libmin_msize(MFILE *mfile);

/* at end of file */
int libmin_meof(MFILE *mfile);

/* close the in-memory file */
void libmin_mclose(MFILE *mfile);

/* read a buffer from the in-memory file */
size_t libmin_mread(void *ptr, size_t size, MFILE *mfile);

/* get a string from the in-memory file */
char *libmin_mgets(char *s, size_t size, MFILE *mfile);

/* read a character from the in-memory file */
int libmin_mgetc(MFILE *mfile);
```

## Hash-Alone execution

Hash-alone execution targets (e.g., hashalone-host, hashalone-spike) allow pure bare-metal benchmark execution. As such, benchmarks configured for the hash-alone targets can execution completely and verify their results with NO output or input devices. To run the benchmark, simply load its binary and jump to the start address specified in the ELF binary. When the libmin_success() interface is called, simply spin to terminate the program. At completion, the memory variable "__hashval" contains a hash signature of the output of the program as it run, since in this target mode all libtarg_putc() output goes to a FNV1a hash function. The final hash value will indicate the full output of the program. To verify the hash function, use one of the reference hash-alone targets (e.g., hashalone-host, hashalone-spike). For RISC-V targets, to debug a hash-alone output hash signature mismatch, simply use the hashalone-spike target as your golden model -- this target will run the RISC-V binaries deterministically and with the same addresses each time, so it is possible to perform a cycle-by-cycle comparisons against your design-under-test.

## Porting the Bringup-Bench to other targets

To port the Bringup-bench to your new CPU, accelerator, compiler, or operating system, you need only concern yourself with the "libtarg.h" and "libmin.c" files. First define a new target specifier in "Makefile" and then add it to the "libtarg.h" and "libtarg.c" files. Inside the "libtarg.h" file you will need to define basic data type sizes plus define how the benchmarks access "vararg" parameter arguments. Inside the "libtarg.c" file, you will need to define the following four system call interfaces:
```
/* benchmark completed successfully */
void libtarg_success(void);

/* benchmark completed with error CODE */
void libtarg_fail(int code);

/* output a single character, to wherever the target wants to send it... */
void libtarg_putc(char c);

/* get some memory */
void *libtarg_sbrk(size_t inc);
```
